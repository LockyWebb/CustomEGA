# Custom EGA

The Custom Error Grid Analysis package (CustomEGA) allows you to both use 3 different types of existing error grids for error grid analysis, as well as custom build your own. 

## Error Grid Analysis 

Error Grid Analysis (EGA) has typically been used to assess clinical accuracy of novel blood glucose monitors compared to a gold standard. 

Notable EGA include the Parkes error Grid and the Clarkes error grid for blood glucose. The Saugel et al. Error grid for blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systolic arterial pressure(SAP), has also been used extensively. 

The EGA package can implement Error Grid Analysis for the Parkes and the Clarkes error grid.

## This Package

With this package you can use the Parkes, Clarkes, and Saugel et al. error grid. 

You can also define your own custom error grid for whatever use you need.
